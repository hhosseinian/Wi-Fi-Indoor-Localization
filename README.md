# Wi-Fi-Indoor-Localization
Code and documentation for Kaggle competition on Wi-Fi Indoor Localization Dataset

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate Wi-Fi-based indoor localization models using the provided dataset. The project aims to address two main challenges: (1) generalization within a given environment and (2) few-shot learning across different environments. This plan details the steps for data exploration, model development, and evaluation to contribute to advancing indoor localization technology.
Project Objectives

    Develop a robust localization model that generalizes well within a single environment.
    Investigate few-shot learning techniques to enable transferability of the model across different environments with minimal additional data.
    Benchmark and evaluate models using the provided dataset and performance metrics.

## Detailed Plan
1. Initial Setup and Data Exploration
1.1. Repository Setup

    Create a GitHub repository to manage code, data, and documentation.
    Organize the project structure:

    kotlin

    kaggle-wifi-localization/
    ├── data/
    ├── notebooks/
    ├── scripts/
    ├── models/
    ├── results/
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── README.md

1.2. Download and Organize Data

    Download dataset files from Kaggle and place them in the data/ directory.
    Inspect data files (.h5) using tools like HDF5 viewer or Python libraries (h5py).

1.3. Data Exploration

    Analyze Data Characteristics: Examine the structure of datasets, data types, and features.
    Visualize Data: Plot distributions of RSSI values, Wi-Fi access points, and location data.
    Identify Missing Values: Check for and handle missing or inconsistent data.

2. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
2.1. Data Preprocessing

    Normalization: Normalize RSSI values and other features.
    Feature Extraction: Extract meaningful features from the raw data, such as statistical summaries of RSSI values.

2.2. Train-Test Split

    Environment-1: Use training_data_env1.h5 for training and split into training and validation sets.
    Environment-2: Prepare for few-shot learning by using training_data_env2.h5.

3. Model Development
3.1. Baseline Model

    Implement a basic model to establish a performance baseline.
    Use traditional methods like k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) or a simple neural network.

3.2. Advanced Models

    Deep Learning Models: Develop advanced models using architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
    Localization Algorithms: Experiment with specialized algorithms such as RSSI-based positioning or time-of-flight methods.

3.3. Few-Shot Learning

    Implement few-shot learning techniques to test generalization from Environment-1 to Environment-2.
    Experiment with transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies.

4. Model Evaluation and Tuning
4.1. Evaluation Metrics

    Use the provided evaluation metric: mean of the 50th and 95th percentile distance errors.
    Convert predictions from meters to latitude/longitude.

4.2. Hyperparameter Tuning

    Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search.

4.3. Cross-Validation

    Apply k-fold cross-validation to ensure model robustness and mitigate overfitting.
